# DIY Gaming Mouse

This repository contains the code, schematic, PCB layout, and 3d model for a completely DIY gaming mouse, all designed around a Pixary PMW3360 sensor.

None of the companies that make gaming mouse sensors sell them, Pixart is included, so the sensor needs to be salvaged (or bought from a scalper, or a small business that specializes in reselling them).
